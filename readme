*Welcome to the Biodiversity Genomics course, held for the first time at IKIAM, in Tena, Ecuador!*
This course is an adapted version of the [speciation genomics course](https://speciationgenomics.github.io/) by Mark Ravinet and Joana Meier. Here you will find all relevant course materials for the biodiversity course, including the files we used during the course in case you want to redo it at home.

Day 1:
- Slides introducing biodiversity genomics and sequencing technologies
- Slides introducing the structure of Illumina reads and fastq files
- Slides on how to login to the Amazon server
- Excercise on exploring Illumina reads
- Excercise on filtering Illumina reads with fastp
