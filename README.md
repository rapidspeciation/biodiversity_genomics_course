This course is an adapted version of the [speciation genomics course](https://speciationgenomics.github.io/) by Mark Ravinet and Joana Meier. Here you will find all relevant course materials for the biodiversity course, including the files we used during the course in case you want to redo it at home.

Day 1:
- [Slides](https://github.com/rapidspeciation/biodiversity_genomics_course/blob/main/slide_presentations/01_BiodiversityGenomics_introduction_JIM.pdf) introducing biodiversity genomics and sequencing technologies
- Slides introducing the structure of Illumina reads and fastq files
- Slides on how to login to the Amazon server
- Exercise on exploring Illumina reads
- Exercise on filtering Illumina reads with fastp which uses these [input files](input_files/Day1_fastp)
