# Welcome to the Biodiversity Genomics course, held for the first time at IKIAM, in Tena, Ecuador!
## held for the first time at IKIAM, in Tena, Ecuador in July 2024
This course taught by Karin NÃ¤svall, Nicol Rueda and Joana Meier is an adapted version of the [speciation genomics course](https://speciationgenomics.github.io/) by Mark Ravinet and Joana Meier. Here you will find all relevant course materials for the biodiversity genomics course, including all files we used during the course in case you want to redo anything at home.

Day 1:
- [Slides](https://github.com/rapidspeciation/biodiversity_genomics_course/blob/main/slide_presentations/01_BiodiversityGenomics_introduction_JIM.pdf) introducing biodiversity genomics and sequencing technologies
- [Slides](https://github.com/rapidspeciation/biodiversity_genomics_course/blob/main/slide_presentations/03_Summary_reads-vcf.pdf) summarising the steps from getting raw Illumina reads, filtering, aligning them to a reference and calling variants and genotypes
- [Slides](https://github.com/rapidspeciation/biodiversity_genomics_course/blob/main/slide_presentations/04_Raw_sequences_quality_control.pdf) introducing the structure of Illumina reads and fastq files
- [Slides](https://github.com/rapidspeciation/biodiversity_genomics_course/blob/main/exercises/Connecting_to_the_Amazon_server.pdf) on logging on to the Amazon server by Carlo Pecoraro from [Physalia Courses](https://www.physalia-courses.org)
- [Exercise](https://github.com/rapidspeciation/biodiversity_genomics_course/blob/main/exercises/01_RawReadsExploration_fastqc.md) on exploring Illumina reads and visualising the quality with fastqc
- [Exercise](https://github.com/rapidspeciation/biodiversity_genomics_course/blob/main/exercises/02_fastp_filtering_reads.md) on filtering Illumina reads with fastp which uses these [input files](input_files/Day1_fastp)
